Assignment to learn work with machine learning. In this case the [TensorFlow.js](https://js.tensorflow.org/) framework is used. Any code is written with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for its static typing.

The intent is to distinguish between nuts and bolts. Any other categories that could get added should work on the same principle. In that regard it shouldn't be too hard to add others, but this would require to retrain the model.

The code is heavily inspired by "[Training on Images: Recognizing Handwritten Digits with a Convolutional Neural Network](https://js.tensorflow.org/tutorials/mnist.html)", as it does basically the same but with a different dataset and categories.

Images in the dataset are rendered 3D models, created with [Blender](https://www.blender.org/).
